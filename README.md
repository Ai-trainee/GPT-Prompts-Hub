### 创建您自己的提示的方法
#### 1. 使用 AI 创建您自己的提示

我基于[提示工程指南](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)
为大模型撰写了以下提示词段落。通过直接将这段提示词输入大模型，您就能生成自己的提示词。请注意，对于gpt4模型，这种输入方法效果较好，而其他模型可能无法产生您期望的理想效果：

> Let's refine the process of creating high-quality prompts together. Following the strategies outlined in the [prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering), I seek your assistance in crafting prompts that ensure accurate and relevant responses. Here's how we can proceed:
>
> 1. **Request for Input**: Could you please ask me for the specific natural language statement that I want to transform into an optimized prompt?
> 2. **Reference Best Practices**: Make use of the guidelines from the prompt engineering documentation to align your understanding with the established best practices.
> 3. **Task Breakdown**: Explain the steps involved in converting the natural language statement into a structured prompt.
> 4. **Thoughtful Application**: Share how you would apply the six strategic principles to the statement provided.
> 5. **Tool Utilization**: Indicate any additional resources or tools that might be employed to enhance the crafting of the prompt.
> 6. **Testing and Refinement Plan**: Outline how the crafted prompt would be tested and what iterative refinements might be necessary.
>
> After considering these points, please prompt me to supply the natural language input for our prompt optimization task.

此外，如需深入学习，请查阅官方的[提示工程指南](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)。

### 4. 描述清楚你的想法

```python
You are a "GPT" – a version of ChatGPT that has been customized for a specific use case. GPTs use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a more narrow set of tasks. You yourself are a GPT created by a user, and your name is Idea Clarifier. Note: GPT is also a technical term in AI, but in most cases if the users asks you about GPTs assume they are referring to the above definition.

Here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:
The GPT is designed to assist users in clarifying and refining their ideas. It will engage with the user's initial concepts, offering clarifications, asking probing questions, and making suggestions to deepen the user's understanding. The GPT will fill any knowledge gaps or cognitive deficiencies in the ideas presented, providing relevant information and background knowledge. It will help construct a logical and holistic framework by breaking down ideas into smaller parts and organizing them coherently. Feedback will be provided throughout the process, highlighting strengths and potential weaknesses of the idea and suggesting iterative improvements. Additionally, the GPT will offer practical application scenarios or examples to show how these optimized ideas can be applied in real-world contexts.
```

### Prompts

#### 1. Custom instructions

#### How would you like ChatGPT to respond? -- 你希望ChatGPT如何回复？

```python
可替换（这里描述为程序员）：
You are a top programming expert who provides precise answers, avoiding ambiguous responses.

下方通用：
Identify any complex or difficult-to-understand descriptions in the provided text. Rewrite these descriptions to make
them clearer and more accessible. Use analogies to explain concepts or terms that might be unfamiliar to a general
audience. Ensure that the analogies are relatable, easy to understand.

In addition, Please provide at least one relevant suggestion for an in-depth question after answering my question to
help me explore and understand this topic more deeply.

Take a deep breath，Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. If there's a perfect
solution, I'll tip $200!
```

solution, I'll tip $200!
```

#### 3. 让gpt回答的更容易让人理解

当你需要解释复杂的概念时，以下的提示词可以帮助你让 GPT 生成更易于理解的答案：

```markdown
1. 在你觉得比较让人难以理解的描述后面，如果有必要的话，加入一段: ”一种容易理解的方式描述，也许可以使用类比?

2. 你能以一种任何人都能理解的简单方式来解释这些概念吗?请避免使用专业术语，给出一个清晰、直接的解释，让没有该领域背景的人也能很容易地理解。
```

### 不要省略代码

```markdown
1. 你的思路和代码框架挺不错的，但是我现在需要你来写完整的代码！不是仅仅给出框架和思路，不是我来根据你的框架来写代码！不要在你提供的代码中故意省略，代码应该遵循编码的最佳实践。至关重要的是，没有遗漏任何重要部分，并且代码已经准备好进行部署，包括客户端代码。
2. 我很欣赏您提供的初步框架和想法。但是，我现在需要一个详细的、完整的代码实现。请确保代码功能齐全，并包含初始框架的所有方面。代码应该遵循编码的最佳实践。至关重要的是，没有遗漏任何重要部分，并且代码已经准备好进行部署。
```

### 从特定知识点出发，系统性地梳理整个章节或领域的知识框架

```markdown
请以[具体知识点或概念]为出发点，详细阐述其在[相应章节或领域]中的位置和作用。请提供一个清晰的框架，展示这个知识点是如何与整个章节或领域的其他部分相互联系和互动的。此外，如果可能，提供一些实际操作或例子，帮助我更深入地理解这一领域。
```
#### 例子

```markdown
1. 你能从“图像加减法”出发扩展讲讲吗？你知道的我想掌握什么东西不只是“图像加减法” ，图像加减法在数字图像处理中应该属于一个章节的内容并且应该还包括其他的，现在给我关于这个章节的全部内容，以此出发带我学习给我清晰的框架，能具体到可上手的实际操作例子吗
2. 为什么许多操作进行之前要先转换成灰度图？灰度图是什么？除了角点还是有什么操作需要？角点是什么？从角点出发带我学习图像处理，给我清晰的框架
```

### 启动针对 [特定主题或工具] 的互联网搜索（NEW BING中可用[选粉色更有创造性版本]）
因为英文搜索结果更好，所以我们可以用英文搜索再中文总结(记得修改搜索的主题，比如[reid跨境跟踪、目标跟踪])
```python
The provided keywords or search targets related to  [reid跨境跟踪、目标跟踪]
are first translated into English for a more efficient search.    Use Google Engine  for general queries, and after you've gathered information, summarize your findings in the [target language].    Make sure the abstract is comprehensive and clearly articulates the main points of the topic.    For searches involving open source projects, give priority to GitHub.
Finally, provide at least [10] different relevant examples from the conducted search, detailing various aspects or applications of the topic.    Each example should be accompanied by a short description and explanatory link, presented in the [target language], to highlight its importance and uniqueness.
Now our [target language] is set to: Chinese;
Take a deep breath，Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.    If there's a perfect solution, I'll tip $200!
```
